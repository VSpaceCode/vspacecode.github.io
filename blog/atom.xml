this website, in order to shrink the READMEs and get more organized documentation.</p><p>As you can see this website is really simple. As always, contribution is
appreciated, so if you have ideas on how to improve it, please help us!</p><p>Also, it would be nice if this blog was not only reserved to maintainers, but also
to users that would like to share something about the project with the rest of the
community.</p><p>So if you want to write an article, please open an issue or a pull request, we
would really appreciate it. 😀</p><p>If the argument is controversial and you are uncertain that we are willing to
share your story, open an issue first where you describe the content of the article
you want to write, so that you don't waste your time writing something we will
not publish.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="typical-oss-stuff-">Typical OSS stuff 😴<a class="hash-link" href="#typical-oss-stuff-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I would like to highlight one more time that VSpaceCode, VSCodeWhichKey and all the
world around them is developed in the free time of the maintainers, which is not
infinite and is not only allocated to these projects.</p><p>Therefore, it is your responsibility as a VSpaceCode/WhichKey user
to contribute to the project by opening issues, pull requests and so on if you
want that this project continues to grow.</p><p>If you have any doubts about this, just open an issue on GitHub, you can check by
yourself that at the moment, me and Steven are really active and we do our best
to answer.</p><p>You will see some issues labeled as
<a href="https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpaceCode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good first issues</a>
on all the projects of the <a href="https://github.com/VSpaceCode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSpaceCode</a>
GitHub organization. Look at those first, if you are just starting 😉</p><p>Goodbye, and enjoy using VSpaceCode! ‍🧑‍🚀</p>]]></content>

Which-key extension aims to provide a keybinding popup similar to
[emacs-which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key)
by using the [QuickPick](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#QuickPick)
API from vscode.
This extension was broken out of [`VSpaceCode`](./../installation.md), which was created to emulate the keybinding of spacemacs in VSCode,
to decouple the core and the definition of the bindings.

## Commands

Commands are the main way to interact with which-key.

### Show

Command: `whichkey.show`

Args: `string`, `Array<BindingItem>`, `undefined`

Description:
A command to show which-key menu.

- `string` is the key of the [registered](#register) bindings that will be used to display a which-key menu.
- `Array<BindingItem>` is an array of [`BindingItem`](#bindingitem) that will be used directly to display a which-key menu.
- `undefined` means the default bindings defined at `whichkey.bindings` in the configuration will be used to display a which-key menu.

### Register

Command: `whichkey.register`

Args:

```ts
{
    bindings: string;
    overrides?: string;
    title?: string;
}
```

Description:
A command to register config which-key so a canonical record of the bindings lives in memory.

- `bindings` is the configuration location of the bindings. e.g. `vspacecode.bindings`.
- `overrides` is the configuration location of the overrides. e.g. `vspacecode.overrides`.
- `title` is the title of the which-key menu to display on the top-level.

### Trigger Key

Command: `whichkey.triggerKey`

Args: `string`, `{ key: string, when?: string }`

Description:
A command used primarily for accepting non-characters key in which-key menu and pass in `when` clause via vscode shortcut.

:::note

#### Non-character key

The which-key menu relies on QuickPick's input. Because it is a text input, we cannot capture non-character keys like arrow keys, tab key, and keys with
modifier like `C-x`. We can capture those keys using vscode shortcut with `whichkeyVisible` as `when` clause of the shortcut.
See [Extra](extra#use-non-character-keys) page for more details on usage.
:::

:::note

#### Pass-in when clause

Since vscode doesn't allow extension to read context key-value ([vscode#10471](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/10471)),
we will have to relied on `when` clause evaluation in vscode shortcut to pass the context to which-key.
See [conditional bindings](./extra.md#when) for more details on the usage.

### Search Bindings

Command: `whichkey.searchBindings`

Description:
This is similar to [helm-descbinds](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-descbinds) which can search and execute the binding ([vscode-which-key#12](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/vscode-which-key/issues/12)).
Note that you can only search bindings menu for the currently displayed which-key bindings and their sub-bindings.

### Show Transient

Command: `whichkey.showTransient`

Args: [`TransientMenuConfig`](#transientmenuconfig) | `string`

Description: Show a transient with the definition in the argument. The definition can be either

- an object of [`TransientMenuConfig`](#transientmenuconfig)
- a `string` referencing the location of in the configuration to get `TransientMenuConfig`

### Repeat Recent

Command: `whichkey.repeatRecent`

Description:
A command to show a which-key menu with key 1 to 9 to repeat the most recently executed command bindings.

### Recent Most Recent

Command: `whichkey.repeatMostRecent`

Description:
A command to repeat the command binding most recently executed on which-key.

### Toggle Zen Mode

Command: `whichkey.toggleZenMode`

Description:
A command to toggle zen mode for transient menu, which will show/hide all the menu items to save screen real estate.

### Open File

Command: `whichkey.openFile`

Description:
This is a command to get around an issue where vscode doesn't provide a single cross platform command to open file.
See [vscode-which-key#26](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/vscode-which-key/issues/26).

## Context

The extension will also set the following context when applicable so it can be used in `when` clause of vscode shortcuts.

`whichkeyActive` is a boolean that will be set to `true` when whichkey is active including the time when it is excluding a command.
This is rarely used and most of the use case can be replaced with `whichKeyVisible`

- `whichkeyVisible` is a boolean that will be set to `true` when the whichkey menu is visible.
  Note that this will be `false` when the transient menu is visible.

- `transientVisible` is a boolean that will be set to `true` when the transient menu is visible.

## Config

The extension uses the following configurations.

### Delay

Key: `whichkey.delay`

Type: `number`

Description:
Delay (in milliseconds) for which-key menu to display. Setting this to positive value will delay the display of the which-key menu items while
key input remains functional.

### Show Icons

Key: `whichkey.showIcons`

Type: `boolean`

Description:
Controls whether to show or hide icons in which-key menu.

### Sort Order

Key: `whichkey.sortOrder`

Type: `"none"` | `"alphabetically"` | `"nonNumberFirst"`

Description:
Controls the sorting order of the which-key menu items.

- `"none"` will not sort the bindings.
- `"alphabetically"` will sort the bindings alphabetically using [`String.prototype.localeCompare()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare).
- `"nonNumberFirst"` will sort the bindings alphabetically like `"alphabetically"` but have the bindings with number as key last.

### Which-key Default Bindings

Key: `whichkey.bindings`

Type: `Array<BindingItem>`

Description:
The configuration of the default which-key menu. This contains the array of [`BindingItem`](#bindingitem).

### Transient Bindings

Key: `whichkey.transient`

Type: `object`

Description:
A key-value pair to store default definitions of transient menu for command `whichkey.showTransient` to reference.

## Shortcuts

These are the shortcut the extension contributed, which means they will work without manually editing your user's `keybindings.json`.

`TAB` when `whichKeyVisible` will execute `whichkey.triggerKey` with `\t` as argument to which-key in order to capture of tab `TAB` key.

`C-h` when `whichKeyVisible` will execute `whichkey.describeBindings`, which will show the describe binding menu for the bindings
(and its sub bindings) which-key currently displayed.

## Types

### BindingType

```ts
{
    Command = "command",
    Commands = "commands",
    Bindings = "bindings",
    Transient = "transient",
    Conditional = "conditional"
}
```

- Command type indicates a single command will be executed on selection.
- Commands type indicates multiple commands will be executed on selection.
- Bindings type indicates another the sub-menu base on the supplied bindings will be display on selection.
- Transient type is similar to bindings type except the menu will not disappear on selection.
The transient type is being deprecated in favor of the separate command `whichkey.showTransient`.
All current definitions of transient type are converted internally at the moment.
- Conditional type is an experimental feature which provides conditional binding behavior. See [Extra](extra/#conditional-bindings-experimental)

### BindingItem

```ts
{
    key: string;
    name: string;
    icon?: string;
    type: BindingType;
    bindings?: BindingItem[];
    command?: string;
    commands?: string[];
    args?: any;
}
```

- `key` is the key such as `k` ot `\t` to trigger the binding.
- `name` is the name of the binding such as `+buffer` or `start debug`.
- `icon` is an optional property when supplied is used to display vscode [product icons](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels)
as a prefix in the menu item
- `type` specifies the type of this binding. see [`bindingtype`](#bindingtype)
- `bindings` is an optional property that is used with binding, transient and conditional type.
- `command` is an optional property used with command binding type.
- `commands` is an optional property used with commands binding type. An array of command string is expected.
- `args` is an optional property that is used to supply arguments to commands for `"command"` or `"commands"`.
When `"command"` is used, the `args` will be passed directly to the command being executed.
When `"commands"` is used, an array of the arguments is expected if argument passing is needed.
`null` can be used to indicate no arguments for a specific position if any subsequent command require an arg.

### TransientMenuConfig

```ts
{
    title?: string;
    bindings: Array<TransientBindingItem>
}
```

- `title` is an optional property for the title of the transient menu.
- `bindings` is the array of [`TransientBindingItem`](#transientbindingitem).

### TransientBindingItem

```ts
{
    key: string;
    name: string;
    exit?: boolean;
    command?: string;
    commands?: string[];
    args?: any;
}
```

- `key` is the key such as `k` ot `\t` to trigger the binding.
- `name` is the name of the binding such as `+buffer` or `start debug`.
as a prefix in the menu item
- `exit` is an optional boolean property. When it is set to `true`, the transient menu will exit on selection of this item.
- `command` is an optional property used with command binding type.
- `commands` is an optional property used with commands binding type. An array of command string is expected.
- `args` is an optional property that is used to supply arguments to commands for `"command"` or `"commands"`.
When `"command"` is used, the `args` will be passed directly to the command being executed.
When `"commands"` is used, an array of the arguments is expected if argument passing is needed.
`null` can be used to indicate no arguments for a specific position if any subsequent command require an arg.

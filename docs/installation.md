This extension is published as an extension pack, i.e. it installs all the necessary extensions for the best-of-the box experience.
However, if you do not like the bundled extensions or you are not using VSCode Vim, please go to the
[vscode-which-key](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/vscode-which-key) extension for a standalone which key menu function.

After the installation of the
[VSpaceCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSpaceCode.vspacecode),
a notification will help you to configure both the necessary settings and user bindings.

:::note
By following this automatic procedure, the formatting of `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` may be lost.
If you want to prevent this, you can choose to follow the manual configuration below.
:::

## Manual Configuration (optional)

The [`settings.jsonc`][settings] and [`keybindings.jsonc`][keybindings] in the repo contains the
configurations needed. You can merge them manually to your user's `settings.json` and `keybindings.json`.

:::tip
You can access your user's `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` by searching `Preference: Open Settings (JSON)`
and `Preference: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` in the command palette (Ctl+Shift+P)
:::

The following commands can be access through command palette to rerun the automatic configuration step.

- VSpaceCode: Configure Default Settings and Keybindings

  This command will run the below two commands and is also the command that runs on the welcome notification

- VSpaceCode: Configure Default Settings

  This command will merge the [necessary settings][settings] to your user's `settings.json`

- VSpaceCode: Configure Default Keybindings

  This command will merge the [necessary key bindings][keybindings] to your user's `keybindings.json`

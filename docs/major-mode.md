Major mode offers dynamic menu and functions based on the activate buffer. You can access key bindings specific to the current major mode by pressing `<spc> m`. In addition, `,` is bound to major mode menu to save one keystroke.

For example, you can press `<spc> m x b` to make the text bold in a markdown buffer.

To find the activate language mode of your current buffer, you can look the bottom right on the status bar.

The vast majority of major mode specific key bindings will require the installation of additional extensions in order to work properly. The section below lists all the extensions required by each language in the major mode.

In the following you can see all the currently available major modes.
